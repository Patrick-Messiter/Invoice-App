# Invoices Application

This project is an application to create, edit, delete and view invoices.

The application was created in React and bootstrapped with Create React App. Additionally, other packages were used including Framer Motion.

The application saves the main state which contains the invoice data to local storage.

The project is currently being hosted using Github Pages and can be accessed at (https://patrick-messiter.github.io/Invoice-App/).

The idea for this project was influenced by Frontend Mentors Invoice App challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl).
